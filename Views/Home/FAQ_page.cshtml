                            On the indicative colleague statement there is a box with Post Employment Notice Payment with ‘TBC’ in the amount box. When will we know if PENP warrants a payment and what the value is for the colleague concerned?
                            <span class="faq-arrow">&#9660;</span>
                        </div>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            PENP must be run on the pay period data before either Official Notice of Redundancy is issued, or the termination date, whichever is earliest.<br />
                            Therefore, this can only be provided once we have the relevant pay period data available. These are therefore included in the ‘updated’ statements but cannot be done prior to this.<br />
                            If PENP does arise, the amount that is subject to tax is moved from ASE, so the gross amount in a colleague’s package remains the same whereas the net may reduce due to tax and NI.<br />
                            More information can be found in the ‘Redundancy Payments – PENP’ section of the FAQ.

                            Additional Service Pay depends on the company’s redundancy policy and may vary based on tenure and contractual agreements.
                            Yes, a service anniversary could impact redundancy pay if it affects the total qualifying service period.

                            Typically, redundancy calculations are based on base salary, but additional payments like First Aid pay may depend on company policy.
                            Being on sick leave or having a planned operation generally does not impact redundancy pay unless it affects salary calculations.
